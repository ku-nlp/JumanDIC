How to update:

* Download a new version of emoji test file from Unicode DB
* Run `python3 scripts/emoji_gen.py emoji-test.txt emoji.dic`
* Clean any duplicates with current dictionaries
* Update the version below as well

Current Unicode DB: http://unicode.org/Public/emoji/14.0/emoji-test.txt
The url can be invalid.
In that case go to http://unicode.org/Public/emoji and then to the latest subdirectory there.
Find there emoji-test.txt and copy it here.
